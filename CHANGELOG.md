## [0.20.0] - 2025-06-03

### Added

- Introduced advanced deep utility types: `DeepFilter`, `DeepReplace`, `DeepSet`, and others, enabling powerful and flexible manipulation of deeply nested object structures. These types allow for filtering, replacing, and setting values at any depth, making complex type transformations easier and safer.
- Enhanced `DeepOmit`, `DeepPartial`, and `DeepPick` by leveraging the new `IsObject` type for stricter type checking, reducing code duplication and improving reliability. [#164](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/164)
- Added `DeepNonNullish` for object types and `FilterNonNullish` for array types, providing utilities to recursively remove `null` and `undefined` values from deeply nested structures. [#169](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/169)

- Refactored and reorganized utility types into more focused and descriptive files for better maintainability and usability:
  - Renamed `array-types.ts` to `arrays.ts`
  - Renamed `object-types.ts` to `objects.ts`
  - Renamed `string-mappers.ts` to `strings.ts`
  - Renamed `type-guards` to `guards.ts`
  - Introduced new files: `deep.ts` and `numbers.ts`
  - Removed `types.ts` in favor of dedicated type files
  - Deprecated the `/utility-types` entry point, scheduled for removal in the next major release  
     [#171](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/171)
- Added `DeepUnion` type. [#177](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/177)

### Fixed

- Resolved issues in the `DeepReadonly` type where function properties were not handled correctly, ensuring that deeply nested functions are now preserved as expected during readonly transformations.
- Resolve redundance deeply generated by `DeepKeys` type. [#177](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/177)

### Removed

- Cleaned up the codebase by removing redundant or deprecated types as part of the restructuring and modernization effort, reducing maintenance overhead and potential confusion for users.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added

- Added `DeepTruncate`, `IsFunction` types [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)
- Added `IsArray` and `IsObject` type guards for creating strict checking of the types provided. The aim of the introducion of these two types was because typescrip takes a function like an object which was creating unexpected result by advanced object utility types [#159](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)
- Added `DeepPartial` and `DeepRequired` types for complement and provided an advanced type that the build-in types `Partial` and `Required` provided by typescript by default [#161](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/161)
- Added `DeepNullable` and `DeepNonNullable` types for deep nullability transformations. [#163](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/163)

### Changed

- Improve `DeepMutable`, `DeepReadonly`, `MapTypes` to check a strict type when the operations are nested generated by `extends object` which was a bad comparation which takes a function as an object, so was implement the `IsObject` types to support the strict checking [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)

### Fixed

- Fix error in `DeepReadonly` type caused when exist a function. The issue was solved with `IsObject` type which has a strict checking if the value is object or not [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)

## [0.18.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added

- Added `DeepKeys` utility types for get all keys of an object at any depth. The aim of this new utility type is provide an autocomplete by the others types provided by the package that works deeply like `DeepPick`, `DeepOmit` and future advanced types for object types [#152](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/152)
