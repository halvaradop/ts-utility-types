## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added deep utility types: `DeepFilter`, `DeepReplace`, `DeepSet`, and others for advanced object manipulation.
- Added `DeepNonNullish` and `FilterNonNullish` types for filtering nullish values at any depth.
- Added `DeepNullable` and `DeepNonNullable` types for deep nullability transformations.
- Added `DeepPartial` and `DeepRequired` types for recursive partial and required object types.

### Changed

- Restructured utility types into grouped files for better maintainability and clarity.
- Improved utility types and tests for more robust type safety and coverage.
- Updated dependencies in `root` and `app` to latest versions.
- Updated CI workflow: improved `ci.yaml` and added a dedicated `test` job.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues in `DeepReadonly` type when functions are present, ensuring correct handling of function properties.

### Removed

- Removed redundant or deprecated types as part of the restructuring and cleanup.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added

- Added `DeepTruncate`, `IsFunction` types [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)
- Added `IsArray` and `IsObject` types [#159](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/159)
- Added `DeepPartial` and `DeepRequired` types [#161](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/161)

### Changed

- Enhance `IsObject` type for creating strict checking of an object due to typescript take a function like an object [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)
- Improve `DeepMutable`, `DeepReadonly`, `MapTypes` to check a strict type when the operations are nested generated by `extends object` which was a bad comparation which takes a function as an object, so was implement the `IsObject` types to support the strict checking [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)

### Fixed

- Fix error in `DeepReadonly` type caused when exist a function. The issue was solved with `IsObject` type which has a strict checking if the value is object or not [#158](https://github.com/halvaradop/ts-utility-types/pull/158)
