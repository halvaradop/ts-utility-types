# @halvaradop/ts-utility-types/types

> **[DEPRECATED]**
>
> The `/types` entry point is **deprecated** and will be removed in the next major version.
> Please use the default export from `@halvaradop/ts-utility-types` or import specific types from the appropriate entry point.

This file does not export any types or utilities. If you need utility types, see the main documentation and use the recommended entry points:

- `@halvaradop/ts-utility-types/objects`
- `@halvaradop/ts-utility-types/arrays`
- `@halvaradop/ts-utility-types/strings`
- `@halvaradop/ts-utility-types/validate`
- ...and other available modules.

> See the main documentation for more information on migration and recommended usage.
